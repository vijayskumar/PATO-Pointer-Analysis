# Pointer-Analysis

[TOC]

A basic Andersen pointer analysis based on Clang and Prolog

+ context sensitive(?)
+ field sensitive 
+ flow insensitive 

This will be improved.

## Install

### Install the Clang/LLVM 

The C parser is built on top of Clang-3.7, so install the Clang-3.7 
(other version may also work). 
A recommended method under Debian/Ubuntu is to use the apt repository

http://llvm.org/apt/

## Usage

1. Extract information from AST and build the knowledge base using the
Clang tooling frontend:

	```
	ast2db input.c > out.csv
	# translate from csv to ntriples format so it can be loaded by Prolog
	cat out.csv | csv2ntriples.py > out.trp
	```

2. (Iteractively) Run the pointer analysis inference program

	1. main.pl is the main entry to the program
	
<<<<<<< HEAD
		swipl main.pl out.trp
		
	2. The pointer analysis is run automatically and when it is finished, the terminal is in interactive mode, you can query the results with

		varPointsTo(X, Y).

	or use the helper predicate `getVarId` to get the Id of a variable and query with `varPointsTo(VarId1, VarId2).`.


## Implementation
=======
    	```    
    	swipl main.pl out.trp
    	```	
	
	2. query the point-to relation
	3.
